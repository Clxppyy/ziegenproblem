# ziegenproblem-montyhaulproblem
This functional Java-terminal program represents the "Goatproblem" or the "Monty Haul problem", which opens mathmatical questions about stochastics. In- and Outputs have to be in German. Feel free to use for yourself :)

UNIVERSAL INPUTS (VERY IMPORTANT!):
(Nearly) Every question is related to these two prompts:
Input "Ja", for yes.
Input "Nein", for no.
--> or change the prompts manually by yourself :)

If you start the program it will firstly ask you two things (in German, I translate it here):

1. Do you want to simulate the game automatically?
   (The question is about, whether the program should run the problem by itself a 1000 times to get an acurrate result at the end.)
   Inputting "Ja" will lead to the 2. question (skip the rest and continue reading at the next paragraph).
   Otherwise, if you input "Nein", then you can perform the experiment by yourself.
   It will show you all three doors, you need to type one one the three available numbers for example: "1" or "2" or "3"
   Then it will tell you behind which door one goat is hidden and will ask you whether you want to stay with your decision (universal inputs apply here, "Ja" or "Nein").
   With the prompt "Nein" you have one final guess and then the result will be displayed like if you would stay with your decision by typing "Ja" instead.
   At the end it will say/ask you "Neuer Versuch?", which means "New Try?".

2. Should the decision of to-changing doors always be made, if possible?
   (This question is about, whether the program should change its decision of guessing where the car is hidden.)
   If you type in "Ja", it will NEVER take its old input or the known place of a goat as its next decision.
   At the end it will tell you the chance of winning with your chosen strategy. You can view all the prompts the program did by itself.

I hope my program could help you :)
Please mind that I'm not a professional programmer, as you maybe could tell by my coding skills. Still the program works with no issues, no worries. This was a volunteer project I did for fun, as a show-off for one of my labor-projects and getting more into programming.
